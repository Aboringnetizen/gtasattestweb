4B45722A  You know what I am thinking, CJ? Fuck Las Venturas, fuck this ancient warehouse! You can have it. I'll move to Vice City. At least in Ocean Beach I'll always be under warm sun.
4C28B633  Get back to the ~y~roof~s~.
4CCF0E1E  ~z~Oh, hey, Truth.
4E9D4B14  ~z~You're really killing my fucking vibe here!

50EBBE4C  ~z~My bad, man. I'm just pissed for all of us.
5129D47B  ~z~Look, you buy a dump like this, fix it up and sell it.
55D43F5F  ~z~Listen to Jethro.
56441062  ~z~Look, Carl, this place is gonna get on its feet,
57867A55  ~z~Then make it into a garage.
58C93F95  ~z~OK, next stop the cop station downtown.
5C627374  ~z~was because snake-headed aliens run the oil business?
5F4343A1  ~z~Wassup man.
5FA4FB8C  ~z~Wuh? OK, but you're starting to freak me out with all that space shit, man.
606821E9  ~z~Polar bears?
63AEA911  ~z~He's working a hotdog van at the tram terminal in King's.
662D2D87  ~z~Grade A, tip-top genius, that's me.
6705E5F0  Carl, what happened? The bad people on magic cars have found you?!
67E25DDD  ~z~OK, we're good to go.
685519B5  ~s~Get to The Hospital.
68F6A5B5  ~z~Sup.
6A18E53A  ~z~You tripping again.
6D752123  ~z~Nothin'.
6F38DDAC  Try to land near the ~b~homies~s~ to take over the warehouse. You can also land on the ~y~roof~s~ and cover them from there.
6F9B61AC  ~z~You should drop by the shop sometime, see some of my shit, bro.
7303D47B  ~z~No, but they've been known to shit in the liquor tent, if I remember it right.
73E46C56  ~z~C'mon, dude, what's all that about?
746E1062  ~z~I'm opening a garage in Doherty by the waste ground.

7BC6ED8F  ~z~C'mon stop tripping, man.
7CAB2996  ~z~I know a few guys. Come with me, friend.
7E1ED4B1  ~z~Watch yourself, dude. These cats are real serious.
7EF96C9C  ~z~He could fix a supercomputer with a paperclip.
8136BC80  Chill out, mon, we'll be jumping out in a moment.
81950080  ~z~I told him you're the man to speak to when it comes to electronics.
84168416  ~z~Cover your faces.
88234CAB  ~z~OK, we here.
890B84DC  Of course, Mafia doesn't want me to regain control of it. We need people, and many of 'em! Ring up all your homies, tell them this'll be a real party!
8CD3BDE2  ~z~Oh, man - I'm about to ride with this fool again?
8DA0C83D  ~z~OK, I've seen enough.
8E6640C5  Shit! You'll be piloting, right? I am really scared of heights; when I was a kid I was afraid to stand on a chair! Aaargh!
8E81F8E8  ~z~Don't look interested in anything.
9010B59D  ~z~This here's Vietnamese gang territory.
90F70DB0  ~z~but he's always ready to help fellow travelers along the path.
92A548BA  ~z~Woah man, the energy here - it's fantastic.
9367228D  ~z~Yeah, that's my baby girl right there, holmes!
940AE694  ~z~Look, I wouldn't even know where to start.
95C88CA3  ~z~Now you've got something, and you don't know what to do with it.
979AC9A9  ~z~There's an electronics guy I've had dealings with,
9A87C963  ~z~Sometimes it's best to stay in the dark, kid.
9B130491  ~z~We got your back, CJ.
9D0DB557  ~z~You down?
9DEA0D7A  ~z~Why?
A0932A38  ~z~Holmes, take it easy. At least we're alive.

A226D71F  Get back to the ~y~warehouse~s~!
A2C16F32  ~z~Home, James!
A4C06771  Head to the ~y~warehouse~s~.
A54B1306  Destroy the ~r~heli~s~!
A5ACAB2B  ~z~Leave me alone Berkley!

B26C1258  ~z~I think you popped another microdot.
B620E694  ~z~Yeah, you sick?
B6C75EB9  ~z~If I told you, the likelihood is you'd get a probe up your ass within a month.
B84A714E  ~z~The snowball gets bigger...

D2AB9BBD  ~z~This is stalking!

02B77A88  ~z~Are you supposed to be here?
08DC5CEA  ~z~What?
0FB198F3  ~z~Hey, homies!
13917395  Hey, Carl, man, hi, you see, I have found two problems.
14FCB78C  Hey, cool ride, and with a machine gun on top! MC, you'll shoot!
16AAA9B2  ~z~I'm gonna fuck them up...
21A71117  ~s~Back a cement mixer into position in front of the hole.
2741A179  So, what you are saying is that they have control of the most elite parts of San Andreas, while we actually hold meetings in the fucking docks?!
299A294B  Carl, MC knows something new about this... Syndicate. MC?
2BD7D5C4  Return to ~y~Grove Street~s~.
2EF7ED52  There were crates. Lots of crates. You see, the army buys arms from outside of San Andreas and sells it to the syndicate!
3AF1DCD9  ~z~That's enough!
48D6D4D9  Flush.....
4FBB10C0  Get to the ~y~Santa Maria Beach~s~.
504691EF  Carl, I...
54EDDD0E  ~z~Step away from the toilet!
56A02181  Shit, this is reminding me of something... I am getting a headache...
59F0DDC4  On ntheir site are the Army, Vietnamese and half of Los Santos. We, on the other hand have a bunch of niggers, bikers - drunks and chinese punks. Any other good news?
5E9D19DD  Well, yeah, CJ. While I was driving my red Infernus...
61AD9924  ~z~That's right.
63FB871A  Kill the ~r~machinegunner~s~.
64964303  Eat this, you dickheads!
75B04A1E  ~z~Hey, this site is dangerous!
766D2057  ~z~I been thinking about getting me some new land anyway.
78B6A865  ~z~What up, Carl?
7FDB6C7C  ~z~Those assholes keep saying shit to me!
82A51A73  ~z~Stop where you are!
8443AA1D  Hey, look, there is Owen! Trying to get the fuck away like a damn weasel!
8A98222F  MC:
8DF5E636  Firstly, I have found Malcolm's right-hand man and the organizer of assassinations. His name is Owen, he's a Ballas OG, and he's the brother of Kane, that dickhead we killed last year.
91D50D50  ~z~The construction workers up that hill.
9383136E  Or... Nah, don't get up. They've got machine guns everywhere; you won't even realize you've been iced.
96B8C949  ~z~Do I look like a hooker to you?
9BBE2B32  ~z~Hey, where's your hard hat?
B09378F1  Well, what's the problem?
B2DE847E  Kill ~r~Owen~s~!
B7FEBCE8  Shut up! Don't interrupt me! Well, you see, while I was riding it in the Docks I saw a group of Ballas. They were talking to soldiers!
B8AE40AD  Fuck, the pricks with the bazookas got us! AAAARGH!
B92534DA  Excellent, CJ! Although we didn't find Peter, I don't think he'll go away before he finishes what he started, and we'll hear of him soon!
BFC384B4  Hey, MC, what the fuck has happened, where is Sweet?
C0F98C7E  You have a red Infernus?!
C172F809  They blew up our car, everyone panicked and half of our guys got themselves killed! Man, get up, we have got to find Sweet!
C5D9B4E8  Huh, you think there is anything else we can do.
C94FC055  Well, I... You see... I mean, just listen! I've followed their car to Santa Maria Beach, where they have a hideout, if I'm not mistaken!
CE22044C  They blew up my house, they killed OUR mother, Sweet! You want them to slaughter all of us?! Let's go, we憊e got a big day today!
CFA9703B  Car:
D1DF8563  Kill all the ~r~enemies~s~.
D6B2417A  Get in the ~b~car~s~.
E1BFF9DF  ~z~What the fuck is going on?
E6D23DC6  ~z~Who said this to you?
EA5FABCA  Follow ~b~MC~s~. Don't get up!
F3449A8B  Well, I think we have to catch up to him and, well, cap him!
FAF2D6A0  Secondly, a machine gun is blocking the way. If a grenade would take out the gunner, we'd get an opportunity to find both Owen and Malcolm!
FD9F12B9  Kill all the ~r~enemies~s~.
